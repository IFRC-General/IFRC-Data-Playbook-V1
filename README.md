# IFRC-Data-Playbook-V1
The IFRC Data Playbook v1 is a social learning toolkit to help teams improve their data skills. It is composed of 10 modules with over 120 items (slide decks, exercises, games, scenarios and handouts/checklists) to help teams on their data journey. The IFRC Data Playbook was created and piloted for and by Red Cross Red Crescent network with some partners. The Data Playbook v1 is both an upgrade and change of product from the Data Playbook beta (launched in 2018). The content is a pick-and-choose model designed for short discussions (30 minutes to 1 hour) using participatory session design models to explore lessons and key questions to improve data literacy.

## Methodology
The Data Playbook is the product/toolkit, but the methodology is core to ownership and implementation. Detailed documentation will be included on the methodology. This is a summary of the goals:

**Make a network-centric resource** – Collaboration on resources to create assets for and by the network is a transformation. It was exploratory innovation to create for and by the network using shared and open leadership methods.  

**Network and community building with mentors and ambassadors** – The team convened multiple communities and networks across the Red Cross Red Crescent. Network-building is complex across time zones, skills and language. While the majority of the sessions were in English, this still provided a unique forum to foster community/network building exercises to support leaders and build peer networking on their data and digital journey. 

**Skillshares** – By creating content and spaces, the team used a ‘sharing’ and  ‘learn by doing’ approach  to support exposure to innovation methods, data/digital literacy skills, open methodologies, facilitation, peer training, and documentation skills.  

**Transformation and innovation**  – Both activities show distributed networks can apply open methods to innovate and transform supporting the digital agenda. Participation activities also show a digital divide in our network. If organizations want to transform how they work together as a network, they need to continue to find and support new ways to connect and create.
